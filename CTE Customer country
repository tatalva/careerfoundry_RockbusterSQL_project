Find out how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country. Use CTE
/*CREATE CTE WITH 3.7 QUERY*/
```
WITH top_customers_cte (customer_id) AS (
	SELECT A.customer_id,
       B.first_name,
       B.last_name,
	   D.city,
	   D.country,
	   SUM(A.amount) AS Total_Amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C on b.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN TOP_city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id --- link to the top 10 city view
GROUP BY a.customer_id, b.first_name, b.last_name, b.address_id, d.city, d.country
ORDER BY Total_Amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5)
SELECT F.country,
COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count,
COUNT (DISTINCT top_customers_cte.customer_id) AS top_5_customers
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = c.city_id
INNER JOIN country F ON c.country_id = F.country_id
LEFT JOIN top_customers_cte ON top_customers_cte.country = F.country
GROUP BY F.country
